Citrix XenServer
================

To compile for XenServer, install these sources into the
equivalent XenServer DDK VM, and compile with XEN_DDK=yes:

DDK> export XEN_DDK=yes
DDK> make rpm

The rpm will be written to /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386.
Copy that rpm to the XenServer dom0 host, and install it:

[root@xenserver ~]# rpm -Uvh hsflowd-<VERSION>-1.i386.rpm

Then schedule it to run automatically:

[root@xenserver ~]# /sbin/chkconfig --level 345 hsflowd on

Then start it:

[root@xenserver ~]# /sbin/service hsflowd start

Output will go to /var/log/messages.
