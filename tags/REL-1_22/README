Welcome to the project!

Please port this agent to every OS that you care about.

If you don't see the binary download you are looking for, such as
for Debian, Ubuntu, Solaris, FreeBSD or Darwin, you might find that
you can compile it yourself from the sources.  And if it's
not there either, try checking out the latest "trunk" sources:

mkdir host-sflow-trunk
svn co https://host-sflow.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/host-sflow/trunk host-sflow-trunk

If what you want is *still* not there, please subscribe to the host-sflow-discuss
mailing list and send a request.
